## Problem

Given a number  **n**, print Floyd's triangle with n lines.

Floyd’s Triangle is a pattern of consecutive natural numbers arranged in rows, where the i-th row contains i numbers.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: n = 4
Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
Explanation: The triangle has 4 rows. Numbers start from 1 and increase sequentially across rows, and each row i contains i elements.
```

```
Input: n = 5 
Output:
1
2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9 10
11 12 13 14 15
Explanation: The triangle has 4 rows, and each row i contains i numbers.
```

class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int m = 1;
        // code here
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++){
                System.out.print(m+" ");
                m++;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
