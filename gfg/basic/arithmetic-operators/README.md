## Problem

Given two integer variables x and y, perform the following operations:

- p: Addition of x and y
- q: Subtraction of y from x
- r: Multiplication of x and y
- s: Floating-point division of x by y
- t: Integer division of x by y
- u: Modulo (remainder when x is divided by y)

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: x = 1, y = 2
Output: 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1
Explanation: The given operations are performed:
Addition of x and y = 3
Subtraction of y from x = -1
Multiplication of x and y = 2
Floating-point division of x by y = 0.500
Integer division of x by y = 0
Modulo of x and y = 1
Hence, the output is 3 -1 2 0.500 0 1.

```

```
Input: x = 3,y = 4 
Output: 7 -1 12 0.750 0 3
Explanation: The given operations are performed.
```

```java
import java.util.*;

class GFG {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        int x = sc.nextInt();
        int y = sc.nextInt();

        // code here
        int p = (x + y);
        int q = (x - y);
        int r = (x * y);
        float s= ((float) x / y);
        int t = (x / y);
        int u = (x % y);
        

        System.out.printf("%d %d %d %.3f %d %d", p, q, r, s, t, u);
    }
}
```
