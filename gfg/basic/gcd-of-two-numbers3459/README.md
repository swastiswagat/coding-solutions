## Problem

Given two positive integers  **a**  and  **b**, find  **GCD** of a and b.

 **Note:**  Don't use the inbuilt gcd function

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: a = 20, b = 28
Output: 4
Explanation: GCD of 20 and 28 is 4
```

```
Input: a = 60, b = 36
Output: 12
Explanation: GCD of 60 and 36 is 12
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109

```java
class Solution {
    public static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        // code here
        if(b == 0){
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}

```
