# Middle of Three

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given three distinct numbers a, b and c. Find the number with a value in the middle (Try to do it with minimum comparisons).

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: a = 978, b = 518, c = 300
Output: 518
Explanation: Since 518>300 and 518<978, so 518 is the middle element.
```

```
Input: a = 162, b = 934, c = 200
Output: 200
Exaplanation: Since 200>162 && 200<934, So, 200 is the middle element.

```

```
Input: a = 246, b = 214, c = 450
Output: 246
```

 **Constraints:** 
1<=a, b, c<=109
a, b, c are distinct.

```java
class Solution {
    int middle(int a, int b, int c) {
        if ((a > b && a < c) || (a < b && a > c)) {
            return a;
        }
        else if ((b > a && b < c) || (b < a && b > c)) {
            return b;
        }
        else {
            return c;
        }
    }
}
